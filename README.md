## üìà Overview

### üìÇ Datasets Used
Here, we utilized three evaluation datasets to assess the performance of our Fino1 model.

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[FinQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/FINQA_test_test)** | FinQA is a large-scale dataset for numerical reasoning in finance, featuring expert-annotated QA pairs that require integrating structured and unstructured data from financial reports while handling complex domain-specific terminology. |
| **[DocMath](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yale-nlp/DocMath-Eval)** | DocMath-Eval is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' numerical reasoning over long specialized documents and tables, with the simpllong subset focusing on reasoning across multi-tiered financial or specialized tables within extended contexts. |
| **[XBRL-Math](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/Regulation_XBRL_FinMath_test)** | XBRL-Math dataset evaluates LLMs' numerical reasoning in XBRL filings, requiring models to interpret structured financial data, US GAAP XBRL tags, equations, and hierarchical numerical relationships for accurate financial analysis. |

### üèÜ Models Evaluated
We compared our Fino1 model against 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).

### üß© Reasoning Path Building
For the reasoning path building and training part, we were inspired by [HuatuoGPT-o1](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT-o1)

We release the reasoning path here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/Fino1_Reasoning_Path_FinQA

### üèóÔ∏è How to Train Fino1
Refer to [HuatuoGPT-o1](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT-o1), we applied two-stage way to train our Fino1 model
- **Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

- **Stage 2: Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

We provide a simple PPO script using the [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) library. Below is an example for training an 8B model with PPO on an 8-GPU A100 machine. Ensure you first download [medical verifier](https://huggingface.co/FreedomIntelligence/medical_o1_verifier_3B) as the reward model.

Please check [HuatuoGPT-o1](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT-o1) for more training details.

# üéØ Evaluation of all models

## Inference: Local Models  
Model inference for local models is conducted using **[FinBen](https://github.com/The-FinAI/FinBen)** with the **VLLM framework**.

## Inference: API Models  
For API-based models, evaluation is performed using the **`query_llm.py`** script.

## Evaluation 
For the final evaluation, we used [DocMath-Eval](https://github.com/yale-nlp/DocMath-Eval) to first use GPT to extract final answers from the result and then evaluate the correctness of the answer.
